Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The gaming room has requested the development of a web based version of their current game application. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Readibiltiy and formatting feel like my greatest success with this document. I tried to keep everything simple to read as it is never certain if the client can understand complex wording.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Laying everything out makes the process much easier as the document can be used as almost a guide and decision aid to help in keeping devlopment streamlined.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve devlopment requiremtns section to have more cohesive information. The same types of pros and cons for each section.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is extremely important to keep clients requirements in mind as the system needs to be designed a certain way. If not enough resources are allocated then this can lead to headaches down the road and over developing can cause a waste of resources.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Tons and tons of research was used. Being able to use multiple sources to see teh different upsides and downsides of ceratin applciaitons really helped in the process as it helped to paint a clearer picture for the client.
